Cate: Hi I'm here interviewing my grandpa. Would you like to introduce yourself?,
Mr. S: Sure my name is Richard Stamper. I'm Cate's grandfather.,
"Cate: Okay, we could just get into the questions I guess. So the first one I want to ask is, who is your biggest role model as a young person and why were they such a big role model to you?",
"Mr. S: Biggest role model as a young Person. I would have to say in the era that we grew up, it would've had to have been Franklin, Delano Roosevelt, and uh, At that time, he was the president that got us through the Great Depression, second World War, and was a very positive time for the, for the presidency and, uh, in our household He was like a hero.","Code 54: The Depression, Code 46: WW2, Code 87: Presidents"
"Cate: Yeah. I remember Grandma Reiner always used to tell like she had the one portrait of FDR and actually I have it now. It's in my room. So it's actually, that's pretty cool. Mm-hmm. . Yeah. Moving on to the next question. Um, if you could relive one year or one decade of your life, what would it be and why? ",
"Mr. S: Well, that's a tough question, but I would have to say, I think my 16th year, which you are in now Cate, was probably the happiest year of my life.You know, you get a chance to drive, you get your freedom, and you're becoming a young adult and everything is optimistic and I really did enjoy that year of my life. ","Code 3: Freedom, Code 78: Teenage years, Code 79: Optimism, Code 80: Happiness, Code 40: Positive thinking"
"Cate: Oh, nice. Yeah, I feel like, I mean, obviously things are different now, um, but I definitely understand what you mean. Mm-hmm. , it's like there's a lot going on and it's all kind of crazy, but it is, it's some, like, sometimes it's like a good kind of crazy and like it's fun to kind of have like a lot, there's a lot of, um, optimism that you have.",
"Mr. S: Well, we didn't have the, you, you guys have more restrictions on you, especially now with COVID-19, you have restrictions on your movement. Uh, you live in the suburbs, so you're not able to kind of wander out on your own. We grew up in an urban setting where you could walk out the door and, and basically you didn't have to worry. There weren't the strange things that are going on in today's world. So the parents were more, more at ease, letting you roam . And letting you grow up on your own. There's got a lot of supervision. Can't do that now. ","Code 11: Different expectations, Code 12: Societal expectations, Code 39: Covid, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 30: Outdoors, Code 2: Childhood"
"Cate: Yeah. I mean I, especially now, I feel like it's not getting like the typical teenage experience, but it's still, you know, I think that there's parts of it that are like still the same. Mm-hmm. , and I definitely understand what you mean. Just like having, um, Like, it's just like very, it's very helpful time. Like a lot of things are looking up like a lot of new things, which is really fun. But yeah.",
"Mr. S: I think the exciting thing to be living in your era is the technological things that are happening not only in like the electronic type theater, but also in these healthcare, theater. Some of the new therapeutics are coming on and bioengineering that's really happening right now. I think. It's a very exciting time to be, you know, looking for a career and picking a career. It might, might really be very much fun and, and very helpful. ","Code 72: Positive views of tech, Code 45: Excitement, Code 37: Work/jobs, Code 80: Opportunities, Code 73: Change in Technology"
"Cate: Yeah, definitely. Um, like especially through school, like you had a lot of options to kind of explore your career and like, I guess, um, what you wanna do. It's just everything is like changing. And I went on this, like, I did like a couple of like field trips, I guess, where we would just go and kinda learn what it's like to be like a marine biologist or like a surgeon or something like that. And they're like, oh yeah, it's. And by the time that you get here, it'll be totally different. Mm-hmm. . So it's kind of like, that's just really, that's really exciting. ",
"Mr. S: Um, a lot of the opportunities that you guys have now didn't even exist when we were growing up. You know, it was heavy industry or you know, it was right after World War 2 focused on manufacturing and rebuilding the economy and the world at that time. Yeah, and a lot of these things have resolved, but you guys have opportunities to seek out employment and it's just really never happened. You know, once there, they hadn't been invented yet. You guys are lucky in that regard. ","Code 37: Work/Jobs, Code 46: WW2, Code 80: Opportunities, Code 73: Change in Technology"
"Cate: Yeah, definitely. We learn about the stuff in school all the time. Just like right now everything's just changing so quickly. You know, in 10 years things will be totally different. 10 years ago things were like completely. Just technologically. So I think, yeah, I'd like keep saying this, it's just exciting, but also a little bit, everything's kind of crazy. Mm-hmm. , but for the most part, exciting . Yeah, I think so. Um, I have another question. Um, if you could speak to your younger self, what advice would you give? ",
"Mr. S: Well, I would say to my younger self, don't be so conservative and take more risks. If I had to speak to my younger self, I think you had a tendency.  be more, uh, cautious in our era. Mm-hmm.  and, uh, but that's what I would say. I'd say take more risks than you did not be afraid. Uh, I think probably what I would like to have done is started a company sometime, but, you know, cause life moves on, you just get, uh, different obstacles and that just didn't happen. Mm-hmm. That would be, uh, that would be my biggest consult to myself. The other thing I would say is not to put so much time into your, like in, in our era it was a single family earner.","Code 28: Imparting wisdom, Code 25: Aspirations, Code 81: Taking Risks, Code 12: Societal expectations, Code 37: Work/Job"
"Mr. S: You know, women weren't generally employed then, so your income was an income that fed your family. So really taking a risk. It has impacted your family if it didn't work out that well. So I think most people sort of stayed with corporations. Mm-hmm.  probably longer than they should have, you know? Yeah.","Code 37: Work/Jobs, Code 13: Gender roles, Code 11: Different expectations, Code 81: Taking Risks, Code 29: Change in social norms"
"Cate: Cause you know, again, things are really different. Like both my parents work. If one of my parents wanted to like, kind of take a risk, it wouldn't really have, you know, it's not as much of like a all or nothing kind of situation. ",
Mr. S: Yeah. You wouldn't go to zero income. That's what the threat was in our era.,
"Cate: I was just thinking like, especially like after obviously. I, I have no idea what it was like, but thinking probably after the Great Depression, a lot of people would just wanna be economically stable, which is totally understandable. And risks probably weren't that ideal, I guess.",
"Mr. S: Yeah we were raised by depression era parents, so, you know, obviously they lived through the uncertainty of employment. You know, where the next meal was coming from. And in our case, you know, my dad did lose his job, uh, and he had to depend on the, what they called the government cheese at the time, the subsidies for food. And that was not a pretty sight.","Code 2: Childhood, Code 54: The Depression, Code 53: Fathers, Code 56: Mothers, Code 37: Work/job, Code 17: Social programs, Code 41 Food"
"Mr. S: So I think the memories of something like that does stick in your brain when you're a kid, he would your parents go to the surplus place and get, uh, to get groceries and you just, uh, well, saying to yourself, I don't want that to happen to me If I don't have to, you know? ","Code 2: Childhood, Code 54: The Depression, Code 53: Fathers, Code 17: Social programs, Code 41: Food, Code 25: Aspirations"
"Cate: Yeah, definitely. It's just weird to think how all these events are just gonna shape everything, like our decisions later on.",
"Mr. S: I don't know, I guess I never really thought about like how well I look at this covid situation. To me it's very analogous to 1967, 1968, which was the height of the unrest in the United States, uh, fallout from the opposition to the Vietnam War. Um, mm-hmm. , I was, I was in the Army at the time and, um, when Martin Luther King and, uh, Robert Kennedy got assassinated.","Code 39: Covid, Code 82: The 60s, Code 83: Social Unrest, Code 84: Vietnam, Code 85: The Army, Code 37: Work/Job"
"Mr. S: they mobilized, um, our unit. I was in Colorado, but they mobilized our unit. We went to Denver Airport for a few days waiting to be deployed to a US city that was burning. So, you know, a lot of these things that are going on now adays. <inaudible> and BLM is kind of very similar to the, um, the type of civil unrest that we had during those years prior to beginning of Vietnam War.","Code 85: The Army, Code 37: Work/Job, Code 83: Social unrest, Code 48: Racial. injustice, Code 84: Vietnam, Code 43: Politics"
"Mr. S: And also the other really weird similarities with this covid during the Vietnam War, they used to give the death count every day on the news. The number of soldiers got killed like they're doing now with. How many people have died from Covid death, COVID that, and uh, so you know, in a way history has repeated itself here. It's not quite as bad yet, but I've got a bad feeling about the upcoming election. It seems could get a little crazier than they are right now.","Code 39: Covid, Code 82: The 60s, Code 84: Vietnam, Code 85: The Army, Code 37: Work/Job, Code 86: Newsmedia, Code 43: Politics"
"Cate: Yeah, that is crazy. Similar, like how there's just a lot of civil unrest. Like people, a lot of people are very unhappy and I mean yeah, for sometimes for like, good reason, like, it's just a lot of, there's a lot of stuff going on and like it's affecting a lot of people. There's a lot of violence, a lot of unhappiness. ",
"Mr. S: Yeah. And that's, I think, and in the case in like 1968, the, um, there was really no reason for the war. And they kept trying to, kept trying to win it. Cause no one wanted be the first president to ever lose a war in United States and the people didn't want it and it lasted so long.","Code 82: The 60s, Code 84: Vietnam, Code 43: Politics, Code 87: Presidents"
"Mr. S: Mm-hmm. , I mean, when I, when I got drafted, you know, your cousin, you were uncles who were younger than me, were threatened to be drafted, you know, That was like, they were 10 years younger than me. So it gives an idea how long this thing went on and it, it was awful. And now you've got a situation where there's a big, uh, difference between what we'd like them to be doing rather than what they're doing now with was drafting up a bunch of children.","Code 83: The 60s, Code 84: Vietnam, Code 43: Politics, Code 7: Children, Code 88: The draft, Code 11: Different expectations"
"Cate: Yeah, for sure. I, I don't know if, like, I feel like politics has changed, but sometimes I also wonder if it. Has always just stayed the same and now we're just more aware of it. , like now we see everything. Mm-hmm. , so, so now I'm just kinda like, maybe it was always like this, but now we just know more. So now we can be angrier about it.",
"Mr. S: Well, you're right. I think, again, going back to the technological change in our time you had three, 3 tv stations, NBC, CBS and ABC. And you had anchors there that read the news and it was your only source of news other than the newspapers. Yeah. So now you've got the internet, you've got all these different websites, different opinions.","Code 73: Change in technology, Code 86: Newsmedia, Code 29: Change in Social Norms"
"Mr. S: You've got disinformation, real information. It's hard to sort out the facts and the fiction and, but it does create a lot of anxiety, I think, in terms of what is the truth? You know, just like the debate the  other night. Both guys were lying. So which one do you believe? You know, and, and who's telling the truth? And, and none of it's doing us taxpayers any good because these are major strategies that need to be done and. They're focusing on the wrong things. Yeah. It's, it's a bad time for politicians cause we are, we've elected the wrong people. They're not real . ","Code 43: Politics, Code 86: Newsmedia, Code 73: Change in technology, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 42: Worry"
"Cate: Yeah. It's just, yeah, it's very, I don't know. It's, there's just so much out there. It's hard to, like, what are you, what are you even supposed to listen? Like there's no way to listen to at all.",
"Mr. S:  So, yeah, let, may just take this, uh, this COVID thing we're talking about, they should be getting together and give us a unified message rather than challenging everything because they, they're supposed to pull together and, uh, you know, give the, give the public an honest opinion rather than political pain that's going on.","Code  39: Covid, Code 43: politics, Code 11: Different expectations, Code 29: Change in Social norms"
"Mr. S: I don't know that the answer was right, but again, this is an evolving thing. Also, the parameters of the disease are changing. We know more. Different approaches available now, instead of embracing them, they, they do come up with a solution. One team fights the other, and which does us no good. ","Code 39: Covide, Code 43: Politics, Code 29: Change in social norms"
"Cate: Yeah. Like everything has become very politicized. Mm-hmm.  is not good. , I feel like, like everything, like people's personal beliefs are just kind of clouding, scientific, like consensus, which is, you know, just not good for anyone. Um, and you know, I don't know.",
"Mr. S: It just, yeah, it, you're right. . Yeah. When, when the biggest thing outta Vice Presidential debate, the biggest thing everyone's talking about is to fly. That landed on Mike Pence's head, , you know, something's wrong. Yeah. And I'm sure you, I'm sure you've seen the memes on the internet now, some of those kind funny. ","Code 43: Politics, Code 87: Presidents, Code 86: Newsmedia"
"Cate: Yes. Like it's, yeah, it's, I totally agree. The fly was funny, but they're also, we gotta unpack a lot of stuff from the actual debate part of things, in my opinion. Yeah. I mean, I, there's no, I mean, yeah, we can laugh at the debate and the fly. That's my, yeah. Yeah. ",
"Mr. S: But the, you know, when you watch those newscast, oh my God, the fly, the symbol of this, the symbol that they're really out there, like you said, they're, they're so emotional and filled with hate. They can't, they can't be objective and they can't focus, as we used to say in the business world, they can't see the forests from the trees. I mean, yeah. It's awful.","Code 86: newsmedia, Code 43: Politics, Code 29: Changing social norms"
"Cate: Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um, I have a, I have a good question that I think okay. Will be funny to answer, but what is something about today's youth that really surprises you or is different from when you guys were younger?",
"Mr. S: Well, I'm gonna tell you what I'm surprised about how much people are dissing you guys. You know, if you listen to the media, you would think you guys are a bunch of idiots, . But when I meet you and your friends and Sammy's friends, from my perspective than when I was your age, you guys were much more formed. And really nice people.","Code 28: Imparting wisdom, Code 89: Positive impression of today's youth, Code 10: Pride, Code 86: Newsmedia, Code 79: optimism"
"Mr. S: Uh, I mean, it's, you're so maligned by the reports, you know about the millennials, this, millennials that and I, I, uh, I think it's awful. It's, uh, disrespectful for you guys. Cause you guys, you guys have a, a much more full schedule than we ever had. You don't have the freedoms. We had. We used to, you know, go to school and do some homework and then we were out the door.","Code 89: Positive impression of today's youth, Code 86: Newsmedia, Code 3: Freedoms, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 2: Childhood, Code 78: Teenage years, Code 60: School, Code 7: Children, Code 90: Generations"
"Mr. S: It seems like you guys, uh, you're taking your coursework seriously. Like, I see you guys too. You, you're very more committed. You've got more activities, school activities than we ever had. More clubs and so social things like that. So, but I said if, my overall surprise is, and, and I even said this when your mother and uh, aunt growing up, I used to talk to people at work and I think it's a common thing just to want to paint teenagers in a bad light.","Code 60: School, Code: 89 positive impression of today's youth, Code 7: Children, Code 22: Being active, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 90: Generations"
"Mr. S: But I always said that they were also their, their kids. Now maybe you guys just picked good people to hang out with I mean, yeah. The, the friends of yours and the friends of my daughters that I met were always very impressive compared to some of the kids that I grew up with. And that, that would be, you think that's a surprise? That's what, you know, surprises me sort of reality. But you definitely, you guys are more mature and more informed. ","Code 7: Children, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 89: Positive impression of today's youth, Code 90: Generations"
Cate: I wasn't sure if you were gonna roast me or not. I wasn't sure if you were like that . ,
"Mr S: No, I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I, I don't, I I could never roast you guys. You guys are really well mannered, nice kids. I mean, That's my perspective. I, I can see a big difference in the, um, in the level of the quality of you guys. ","Code 10: Pride, Code 90: Generations"
"Cate: Yeah. I honestly, that's very nice. I , I, yeah, I wasn't sure. Cause I feel like a lot of, like, as you said, like a lot of people don't, Blame, like they blame our generation for a lot of things. And like, I don't mean to, I don't know, I don't mean to get defensive, but like, we haven't even done anything yet. Like, I don't know, we're so young, like how much of an impact can we really have? We've only been alive for like 15 years, you know?",
"Mr. S: You know what I think it is, Kate? Here's what I'll tell you. I think it is, see, older generation is looking at a younger generation, like, and you gotta realize, I, I grew up in the sixties, so the theme in the sixties was, don't trust anyone over 30. Because, because they were tearing down the old hierarchy of, you know, of um, let's say this set the rules, the government and the church and all that. So they were in the process of destroying that and, and the. . And in those days our parents resented that fact. They were dressing differently, they were wearing their hair long, they're growing beards.","Code 82: The 60s, Code 29: Change in Social Norms, Code 53: Fathers, Code 56: Mothers, Code 11: Different expectations, Code 90: Generations"
"Mr. S: It was, it was just a totally counterculture, evolving, and I think it threatened the older generation, like in your generation growing up, you know? And I think it's, I think it's just a probably an age old problem where the younger generation is coming up with new ideas, new ways to live life, new thoughts on what they think is right, wrong.","Code 82: The 60s, Code 29: Change in Social Norms, Code 11: Different expectations, Code 90: Generations"
"Mr. S: And the older generation would like to see. Their values, uh, carried on. Well, it, it just doesn't happen like that. That's life. You know, you guys are going to want to strike out on your own as long as it's not all bad. What's wrong with that? You know? But sometimes those things need to be overturned, so.","Code 82: The 60s, Code 29: Change in Social Norms, Code 11: Different expectations, Code 90: Generations"
"Cate: Oh, thanks, Yeah. I don't think our generation is gonna have, um, I don't know, I guess too many issues with, I feel like we're already pretty like crazy . I know, I know. If crazy is the right word. We're already pretty like fired up. Yeah. I guess we'll just have to see where the next ",
"Mr. S: Well, you guys, yeah. You guys got your, uh, you know, like your, you guys are carrying lots of environmental stuff and, uh, you've got a lot of different social issues. You know, you're more, you know, you're, you're, the composition of the population in terms of diversity is so much different than when we were. , you know, and we grew up in basically a, um, a European type setting, if you will. You know, most of the people that I knew were, uh, descendants of European heritage. Now you've got a mixture of people, like, I mean, lot of Asian content.","Code 90: Generations, Code 91: Diversity, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code "
"Mr. S: Uh, they're so, their background, their history. The culture is fairly different, which is kinda fascinating. I always like different cultures, to be honest with you know, you can learn a lot and they have a different insight in their life than living and what they consider the quality of life. So you guys will be painted by that. It's a, it's a thing that we never had. I mean, you know. ","Code 91: Diversity, Code 49: Cultural appreciation, Code 35: Learning, Code 29: Change in social norms"
"Cate: Yeah, yeah. Like definitely like is. Obviously it's very diverse. Mm-hmm. . Um, and I think it's, it's definitely really, it's really nice getting to like, just meet everyone, you know, who like, give a, get a different perspective on things and what I would normally think there. It's like, like listening to like other people, like what the holidays they celebrate. Mm-hmm. . Like, they're kind like, they're traditional, like, they're like customs, all that kind of stuff. Like the food, which I love to hear about. Very interesting. Yeah.",
Mr. S: You're seeing a world without having to travel basically.,
"Cate: Yeah. Yeah. You know what I mean? Super. You know, grateful for that. Mm-hmm. , I have, um, I have a question, but I think I know the answer to it, but I'll just ask it. Alright. What is something you really enjoy doing or something that brings you a lot of joy? ",
"Mr. S: Something I really enjoy doing. Or something that gives me a lot of joy. Well, it's been fun watching you guys grow up. How about that? Oh, you and Sammy, it's been a real blast to see your grandkids grow up, grow up. I'm gonna miss that with Nicole's kids being way. Uh, I think as far as a fulfilling thing, I, I really did enjoy traveling a lot when I was younger, you know, with my job I got to see a little and, uh, got to little, got to do a lot of nice things that.","Code 6: Positive family relationships, Code 92: Grandchildren, Code 74: Enjoyment, Code 32: Social connections, Code 5: Parenting, Code 26: Travel, Code 37: Work/job"
"Mr. S: But you know, we've talked about things that are very fulfilling. I think watching you guys and having your place by has been really a, at least this last, for last couple decades of my life, I guess you could say, has been, been really a, a fun thing. ","Code 92: Grandchildren, Code 6: Positive family relationships, Code 74: Enjoyment, Code 93: Fun"
"Cate: I'm gonna be honest, I thought you were gonna say golf",
"Mr. S: No. Well, you know, I'm not a crazy golfer. I mean, once or twice a week is enough for me. One thing I really did do, did enjoy doing was sailing. Oh yeah, you did get to see, you know, did get to do a lot of airboat sailing in those days, and that was fun. The other thing I really did like was skiing, skiing was a lot of fun.","Code 63: Hobbies, Code 22: Being active, Code 94: Sailing, Code 95: Skiing, Code 30: Outdoors, Code 74: Enjoyments"
"Mr. S: Mm-hmm. , I like golfing now because that's something I can do That's, you know, pretty accessible now. But I, I can tell you, I can tell you I've never enjoyed  more than two rounds of golf a week. When I, if I'd do three, it would just seem like work  because I'm not that good at it. I like being, I like being outside. You know, golf courses are pretty and fun to be on. Yeah.","Code 96: Golf, Code 22: Being active, Code 30: Outdoors, Code 93: Fun, Code 74: Enjoyment"
"Cate: Especially, I mean, I can't imagine how like beautiful like sailing would be. Yeah. So it's a slow way to travel, but it's fun to get there, you know? Yeah.  . Um, I have another question. What was your favorite thing to do when you were younger? ",
"Mr. S: Tell you, I think the favorite thing that we did is we hung out. We used to, you know, which is something you guys don't do now, cause you living in suburbia, but because our houses really didn't have all this electronic stuff and video games and have to keep you inside and the houses weren't that nice, like the ones, you guys were fortunate enough to live in. We'd go out and meet on the street corner.","Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 2: Childhood, Code 30: outdoors, Code 58: Home, Code 73: Change in technology, Code 74: Enjoyment"
"Mr. S: You know, and we'd get together, we'd, uh, a group of us would get together. We always had enough like kids to pick up a baseball team, and we always organized, uh, our own football games like we used to play. Like I grew up on Montero. We would play Troy Hill, which is another community.  And, and they play out at montroy","Code 2: Childhood, Code 38: Friends, Code 32: Social connections, Code 97: Baseball, Code 98: Football"
"Mr. S: So we organized our own sports and that, but the thing was, it was all the guys you hung out with that formed these teams. And so, you know, we went the dances and things like that, but that was, that was really one of the most fun things to do. And when I was growing up. because, you know, we interacted so much to.","Code 2: Childhood, Code 38: Friends, Code 32: Social connection, Code 93: Fun, Code 74: enjoyment"
"Mr. S: And it was always face to face. It was that way. We didn't have, we didn't have cell phones or anything like that. So, you know, to organize something like that, you can imagine, I don't, I still dunno how we did it. Now you see how groups get organized, like, get organized meeting, unions get organized and all that electronically, its very efficient. I, I still don't know how we got 10, 12 people together there, to form a football team and played pick up games and stuff like that, you know, was 20 people. But we did, and, uh, It's kinda unique, you know? ","Code 32: Social connections, Code 38: Friends, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 73: Change in technology, Code 98: Football"
"Cate: Yeah, yeah. I like, I definitely don't think that could happen now. Mean, obviously a lot of my friends are living, they live like, I can't walk to their houses, but I just like, I feel like everyone, like as you said, like we kind of just, no one really prioritizes, like hanging out. Yeah. Which, is kind of sad.",
"Mr. S: That's what I said earlier, like you asked me about your generation. You guys are, you guys get pulled down every minute of every day as far as I can see. I, I always like that little bit of downtime where you just hang out and tell jokes and swap lies and, you know, play cards or do something, you know, as a group and that, that always was. With no commitments. You know what I mean? Our summers were not committed. We didn't, we didn't do camps and things like that, so we, we had to create our own entertainment, you know?","Code 90: Generations, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 3: Freedom, Code 2: Childhood, Code 32: Social connections, Code 38: Friends"
"Cate: Yeah. Yeah. I, yeah. No one really, like, I feel like everyone, every time we try to like plan a hangout, I mean, I do this sometimes too. I don't mean to like attack anyone, but like, they're like always people say like, sorry, I can't go, you know? Mm-hmm. , you have to reschedule. You know, like it's, it never can just be like, Hey guys, let's hang out today. Or like, you kind of have to like be very meticulous with it and like, you know. Mm-hmm. it's just like, it's hard. Like, I mean, everyone either has homework or, you know, something else, like in my world, I guess to be like rehearsal or like dance class, something like that. Mm-hmm. . So like you always, everyone always kind of, An obstacle. Mm-hmm. . But yeah, I feel like it's hard, like it's hard to make, you know, just like having fun a priority.",
"Mr. S: Mm-hmm. , it's like, which is sad because you know, when you're like 16 years old, like, you should get that. But I also, you know, I don't mean to complain because I'm, I do like a lot of the stuff I do, and I'm glad to be able to do it. Yeah.",
"Mr. S: I'd say your stuff will lead to a more productive end where you pick up a skillset.Like we were meeting and just, you know, say, hey, meet at the ball field at 12 o'clock and people would just show up or meet a basketball court or the football field or something like that, you know, but you guys have more structured things might actually lead to a skillset that' helps them more later in life. And ours was more, ours was more people interactions.","Code 90: Generations, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 89: Positive impressions of youth, Code 98: Football, Code 32: Social connections, Code 65: Skill acquisitions"
"Mr. S: And I think, uh, as far as our generation goes when get face to face, Sense things better. Cause you know, you, you've kind of been doing that your whole life. Like you're in the meeting room with a bunch of people. Like in a business scenario, you can tell who's for you, who's against you, who's lying, who's not I mean, it's really, it's really weird, but your instincts are better. ","Code 90: Generations, Code 70: Communication skills, Code 37: Work/job"
"Cate: Yeah. Um, I have a couple of questions like, I guess wrap up questions. Okay. So what are some life lessons that your parents taught you? How are they so relevant to you? ",
"Mr. S: Um, growing up, like we did more or less our depression era kids, you know, depression, era of parents, one thing they taught you was the value of money. You didn't throw it around like, you know, like you see today. You guys are more apt to spend money and funny, I was talking to someone a while ago and we were talking about how, gee, we've got more money now than we ever thought would have, but we just don't wanna spend it  and we can't put our finger on it. But I think it has to do with the value system that the, um, what your parents gave you, you know, which is the one I got.","Code 54: The Depression, Code 99: Money, Code 69: Success, Code 54: Fathers, Code 56: Mothers, Code 24: Abundance, Code 28: Imparting wisdom"
"Mr. S: And I attended a seminar one time when I was working the name of the program was. You are now what you were then, what it basically meant is when you were growing up with your parents, they were talk, you know, they were saying, like, in my case, okay, go to college, get that shingle, go to college, get that piece of paper.","Code 12: societal expecations, Code 54: Fathers, Code 56: Mothers, Code 16: College, Code 71: Working hard, Code 69: Success"
"Mr. S: You know, don't do this, don't do that, and you think you're gonna avoid that, but then you, it starts coming outta you later in life. You know, that you don't even know you're doing it, but you then become your dad or your mother or something like that. It really, it really is funny, but it does have an impact.","Code 90: Generations, Code 54: Mothers, Code 56: Fathers"
"Mr. S: And one of 'em was definitely economics, uh, and, you know, mostly treating people fairly and being honest as much as you can. Uh, that was all, don't, you know, don't lie, but just something didn't pick on my one brother. He likes to lie, but , I, he's, because you can never remember your lies, we always get trapped on them.","Code 90: Generations, Code 68: Helping others, Code 100: Honesty, Code 51: Siblings, Code 28: Imparting Widsom"
"Mr. S: You know? So as far as that goes, I'd say it was fairly a, a fairly Christian upbringing too in those days. Cause most people you would come across. And so that value system of Christianity was imposed on kids. Cause you went to a parochial school. And so the, the life lessons of Christianity were pretty, pretty well.","Code 29: Changing social norms, Code 57: Religion, Code 60: School"
"Mr. S: You know, imparted on kids because if, even if like today, like in my case, I'm not a prac practicing Catholic, I still value the ethics they taught us and the, the knowledge of what is right and what is wrong. So you know, you know what's right and what's wrong and no one has has to tell you. And I think they learn that from, from the, uh, his school and teachings of Christianity, which is something that probably your generation has missed out on as.","Code 29: Changing social norms, Code 57: Religion, Code 60: School"
"Cate: Yeah, definitely. Like, I feel like not even just Christianity, just like, I guess like all religions, like having, I guess like a moral kind of code. Mm-hmm. , like we don't really have, which I mean is like, is good and bad mm-hmm. , but it'd be nice to have kind of a thing you can fall back on and be like, kind of go to if you're like looking for something, if it's right or wrong. But I mean, you know, with everything they're.  with all like practicing religion or pros and cons to everything. But, um, I mean, I think that's great that like people would have that. ",
"Mr. S: Yeah. It's a foundation to build on, which it gives you a base and uh, you know, you gotta sort out the good, the bad sometimes and, you know.",
"Cate: Yeah. Yeah. I have another question. Sure. Um, what did you think 2020 was gonna be like when you were young? ? ",
"Mr. S: I thought, I didn't think I'd lived this long. , I never thought I'd see 2020, um, if 2020, I, I guess I, if you would've told me, like if I was, let, let's assume you're talking about your age. When I was 16, there was a book that came out shortly thereafter Brave New world. And it seems so farfetched that the, if the world could move in this direction that you would, it would sounded so preposterous. And if you go back your, have you read that book at all? No, I haven't.By Aldus Huxley, if you read that book and, and take the time period in which it was written and see how it stacks up.","Code 64: Reading, "
"Mr. S: This guy was a true visionary. I would've never guessed what he said would come true. And we're pretty close to it. I mean, we really are. The way technology has advanced, uh, I, I thought, I, I never, I didn't know what to think of 2020, to be quite honest with you,at your age. I thought the, um, you know, your vision of how things can change and how fast it can change.",
"Mr. S: Isn't that, uh, solid at that age. But as you get older, you see things changing pretty fast and really speeds. Now there things changing In years it would take light years to change when I was growing up, you know? But, um, if I had to pick it, I guess I would've, I would've said it would just be pretty much what I was used to.","Code 29: Changing social norms, Code 73: Change in technology"
"Mr. S: You know, I could have a nice work life, nice job if you, um, put your nose to the grindstone, got a good education and work hard, you could be successful and you were not limited in opportunities. I see some of that disappearing now with the way things are getting stacked. But, uh, I don't know. I, I didn't think, I never thought the United States would be this close to socialism that I would've never guessed would be even a remote possibility.","Code 29: Changing social norms, Code 71: Working Hard, Code 37: Work/Job, Code 69: Success, Code 43: politics"
"Mr. S: And I don't think it's, um, I never envisioned people having this kind of wealth, to be honest with you. I mean, I never. I was thinking about this when you said to do this interview, you know, we used to sit around the table and say, man, I can only make $10,000 a year. I'd be in the tall clothing. You'd be making a lot of money, you know, and now, I mean, That is such a preposterously, low amount of money, you know?","Code 99: Money, Code 69: Success, Code 24: Abundance, Code 29: Changing social norms"
"Mr. S: And I mean, you could see the conveniences coming on board when I was growing up that our parents didn't have before us like not every family had a car. No one had two cars. One car is what you had, and now people got two cars and homes that are like Probably triple quadruple size of what we saw people growing up in, you know?","Code 29: Changing social norms, Code 24: Abundance"
"Mr. S: So, um, I think that's a hard, that's a very hard question, you know, depends on which change your life. Now as I get older, you can see things evolving and like if you'd asked me when I retired, uh, 15 years ago with some be like, I could probably tell you that I could see this wave of computerization and.","Code 59: Aging, Code 73: Change in technology"
"Mr. S: eCommerce coming along cuz I was involved in some project at work and I could see some of this, um, biotech industry evolving. Cause again, I was involved with the chemical company that had a pretty, pretty robust health science group that you submit information on all the time. So if you'd ask me 20 years ago, I'd say none of this stuff that's happening now is amazing to me.",Code 73: Change in technology
"Mr. S: Except the change of the politics. And, uh, what I would not have predicted is a mean spiritness of people now that I would never predict, I would've thought of people who be fulfilling their material fantasies like they are now. Basically, anything you want, you can get materially, but it hasn't seem to make people happier. They seem a little more, um, disjointed and not connected with the real world anymore. That's kinda a long answer. I hope that gives you some insight anyways.","Code 43: Politics, Code 29: Change in social norms, Code 24: Abundance"
"Cate: No, I mean, I'm trying to think what I think that the world would be like in like 50 years or so and I have no idea. ",
"Mr. S: Yeah, yeah, I agree. There are books. There are books that I read Kate when I read a number of years ago, called Mega Trends and a guy kept updating him.",
"Mr. S: Take the very big trends that were going on and say what's gonna happen. I don't know if he's updated his books or not. I haven't followed that. I've read two of them. They're pretty interesting. If you wanna see someone who's a visionary, these guys can have a good insight as to what might be happening in the future based on what they see happening now. It's not only technology and stuff like that, it's trends in politics and behaviors and things like that. ",
"Cate: Yeah, I, I'll check those out. Cause I, I never, obviously, I never read the book that you were talking about earlier, but mm-hmm. , I think, yeah. I think it'd be interesting to read a book now and then. In 50 years be like, Hmm. Yeah, that's, see how everything turned out? Yeah. How, how right were they? ",
"Mr. S: Yeah. Well, 1984 was certainly that way. Bill Al's book in this, in uh, oh. Yeah. And, uh, that, uh, plays the world. They were both visionary books and.  I mean, incredible. ",
"Cate: Yeah. You know what I almost think of, I think of like the Twilight Zone.",
"Mr. S: Mm-hmm.  Never, they're like, it's the year 2000. Yeah. They act like it's like super futuristic, but then you're like watching it and you're like, wait, that's like now. Yeah. . And then you're like, wait, that's like after now you're like, there's, there's that one episode where like, I forget what they're like technology, like they're like robots or I don't know. You know how that Yeah. Oh God. Yeah. Totally crazy. It's like gone off the rails. Yeah. But yeah, it's like, it's weird though cause I feel like we always think it's gonna be bad. Mm-hmm.  and like, I don't know, maybe today, maybe if someone like came to the future, they would think it was really bad, but like, I guess like now you just like, this is just how it's, yeah. So I think like he, like people are really good at adapting. Mm-hmm.  and like, just making, finding the good out of everything. Mm-hmm.  and like, you know, just making. The best it can be. Mm-hmm. , I think that about wraps it up for like questions and stuff, but if you have anything else you wanna add, feel free to.",
"Mr. S: Yeah, I think, uh, I think we had a pretty good discussion. Kate. I'm, I'm comfortable. Anything else add? Yeah. Thank you for, uh, including me. Kinda fun to talk to you like this philosophically,",
"Cate: Yeah. Thank you so much for being here and for being here virtually, I guess is like the new being here. . Well, okay. Well, good. Okay, honey, you have a good one. Thanks for the call. Thanks, you too. All right. See you now. See you.",
