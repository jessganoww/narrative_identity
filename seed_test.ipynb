It's a wonderful place to live. Wonderful weather. Close to the ocean. So that's where I grew up and it was a, I grew up in a town of Santa Clara, which was right next to San Jose, and it was a town of 5,000 people at the time. Very low key, very nice place to grow up. It was able to ride my bicycle all over the place. Had a lot of freedom. So that's me.  \\\n3  Mrs. R: You know something, I don't think I would take you up on that. Cause you know, life is a real mixture and there's wonderful, and there's some things you don't wanna live agains. So, um, I think my childhood was very, very happy. I had a happy life so, I really don't know that I'd wanna live any of my years again. They were, I had wonderful times raising our children. We decided to have a large family and so we ended up with six daughters and four sons and they're all alive and doing well today. Very proud of them. And, uh, our son, Toby, is living at Pittsburgh and he has a daughter named Taylor who is doing this podcast. So that's where I'm at.    \n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mrs. R: If you could speak to your younger self, what advice would you give? Hmm. Well, I don't, it was really interesting. When I was growing up, there were three choices for women. To work as a job, a secretary, nurse, or teacher. And none of those appealed to me at my young age. And so when I met my husband to be, he had gotten out of the service.

For free. It was wonderful. So he, what he did is he came out here and he ended up going to Santa Clara University and he only had had two years before the war was ended, but they let him stay for four years and he got his education and we got married during that time and that was a really good decision.   \n7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mrs. R: I went to college for one year, and then I was a mom and I really loved being a mom.
